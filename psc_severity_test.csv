Deficiency/Finding: Cash advance as requested by crew not provided on various occasion as evidenced by the cash to crew advance report.

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: During the last voyage, although the Managers tried to provide vessel with Cash To Master on both discharging ports of China, they were advised that it was not possible to do so. The Managers continued to push the agents very hard. After repeated efforts, the Managers were finally able to provide the vessel with a limited amount of Cash To Master, which was sufficient to cover only to a certain extent the cash advance amounts that were requested by the Crew Members. This situation therefore occurred for reasons beyond the Owners' control. It must be stressed out that cash advances on all previous occasions were provided to the crew without fail as per company's policy. There is therefore absolutely no reason why the managers, who were consistent to their policy for providing the full requested cash advances, did not do so in the previous two Chinese ports, unless they were not able to do so for reasons beyond their control.

Corrective Action: The DPA and the Port Captain along with Master discussed with crew members the difficulties that were countered during the previous two port calls and reassured them that at the next port of call Fujairah they will receive all requested Cash Advance as per the managers' standard policy and as it has always been the case in the past. The class surveyor who boarded the vessel at Khor Fakkan to verify the permanent repairs for the 2nd deficiency verified also the corrective action for this deficiency and closed it.

Preventive Action: The DPA, along with the Port Captain and the Crew Manager discussed captioned matter and agreed that although it is the first time that they faced this kind of problem, they will arrange & ensure the following to prevent recurrence: - The Crew Manager to ensure that the amount for cash advance requested by the Crew Members is always arranged to be received in full, as was done up to now. - The Master has been instructed to ensure that he shall always keep a sufficient amount of cash on board, which not to be less than USD 7,000, in order to facilitate the crew in case the arrangement of Cash to Master is not possible at some port due to unforeseen external restrictions. The Crew Manager and the Port Captain to verify the cash remaining on board with the Master upon sailing from each port.

Deficiency/Finding: 15 PPM alarm arrangements - Not as required - On the bilge water separator the 15 PPM alarm unit is unable to switch off the overboard pumping of bilge water when the sample flow is lost

Description Overview: PSC during OWS testing found that overboard pumping of bilges did not stop when the sample flow was lost.

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: As per MEPC 107(49) the OCM meter need to operate or trip the bilge pump if there is no flow in the sensor, which during testing found not installed on the OCM meter. As per the maker, the OCM meter installed on the system was an old model without a flow sensor. However, there was the provision to install the flow switch and activate the alarm.

Corrective Action: Maker have installed a flow switch ( 8 mm ), there are connection terminals available on our Seaguard PCB and the flow switch is embedded in the control SW. To satisfy the PSC inspector, we have arranged a maker's engineer's attendance on 15th March 2023 to install this flow meter and test the system operation to activate the alarm. The class has also been involved to approve this additional modification, while our system remains fully compliant with the MEPC circular after this additional modification.

Deficiency/Finding: 01132 Not properly filled. Tonnage Certificate

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: EXTERNAL FACTOR - [SYSTEM CAUSE: Inadequate communication between different organizations]
LACK OF PLANNING - [SYSTEM CAUSE: Management / Supervision]
As part of our diligent process, we requested the vessel's classification society to update the tonnage certificate after the system installation in 2022. We received confirmation that the reissue of the tonnage certificate is not required. The post-inspection investigation has revealed that, although this correspondence was available on board, it was inadvertently misplaced. As a result, it could not be immediately located and presented to the inspector when requested.

Corrective Action: Class confirmation was located shortly after the completion of the inspection and promptly returned to its designated storage location. Specifically LR confirmed: "" Thanks for the email below. Looking at the GA and referring to IMO TM 5, Circ. 6, Article 3-2-d: ""The term ""alterations or modifications which the Administration deems to be a substantial variation in their existing gross tonnage"" should be interpreted to mean ""an increase or decrease of more than 1% in the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the 1969 Tonnage Convention."""" I concluded that this conversion is not more than 1% of the current Gross Tonnage and there no re-issue of the tonnage documentation is needed.""

Deficiency/Finding: Pollution prevention - Retention of Oil onboard tanks for oil residue too much onboard.

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: Investigation was carried out and revealed that PSC officer reported that there are 'too much' oil residues on-board the vessel; As per latest information received by the Master on 27/11 the vessel's ROB sludge quantity was equal to: 14 m3 Total capacity of sludge tanks as per supplement of the IOPP: 29.4 m3. Therefore a quantity less than 50% was retained on-board at the time of inspection. In addition documented evidence was provided to the PSCO our Company has already requested from the local agent available options to dispose the sludge quantities. As per attached correspondence with the local agent in page 17 dated on Oct 23 2023 it is clearly stated that 'unfortunately this terminal in Paranagua port does not authorize the removal of sludge, as it does not have land access, preventing proper service.'. Therefore our Company has arranged the free disposal of oil residues retained on-board on the second port of call in Brazil at Rio Grande (see attached declaration provided by the reception facility). PSC officers requested the following 'also request a 'Sludge removal plan' coming from Flag state and not from owners.'

Corrective Action: Issue was addressed to our Classification Society where it was confirmed considering the above situation and based on the vessel's technical specification that the vessel has a sludge tank capacity to retain sludge for at least 29 days when she navigates with MCR.

Deficiency/Finding: For tankers of 20,000 tonnes deadweight and upwards, a fixed deck foam fire-extinguishing system shall be provided complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code. The deck foam system shall be capable of simple and rapid operation. Vessel took 15 minutes to demonstrate adequate foam monitor pressure.

Description Overview: As per company's Safety Management System and PMS, all portable and fixed firefighting systems are to be inspected and maintained as per the guidance given in SOLAS Ch II-2 and MSC 1/ Circ. 1432. This maintenance and inspection schedule is maintained and recorded are kept in company's form ""SF-26 FFA Checklist"". In line with the above, firefighting equipment, including fixed foam fire extinguishing system is inspected and records maintained. Foam monitors are also inspected and maintained as per the frequency mentioned in ""SF-26"". The foam monitors are tried out on a monthly basis and the foam line is pressure tested annually. The last foam monitor test was carried out on 05th April 2023, and was found satisfactory. The USCG inspectors during the inspection had checked these records and confirmed were up to date. Prior to the deck rounds during the inspection, USCG PSCO requested the Master to prepare two hoses forward and aft to check the pressure in the fire system, which was satisfactorily demonstrated by the ship's staff. After completion of the fire hose testing the USCG PSCO started the deck rounds along with master. As they proceeded forward on deck, the PSCO requested the master to start the foam monitors. The master informed the CE over walkie talkie and the foam main was charged and monitors started. However, the pressure was noted to be low at both foam monitors giving an insufficient jet. The system and line-up, including the isolation valves near the foam monitors were rechecked and confirmed to be set up properly between the machinery spaces and foam room. However, when pressure still did not increase at the foam monitors, further investigation was carried out and it was noted that after the testing of the fire hoses on poop deck and forecastle, the fire hydrant on the poop deck earlier used for fire hose testing had inadvertently remained fully open, and since the water pressure was bleeding from there, the foam monitors could not get the full pressure. Additionally, one of the anchor washes was also open (which was getting supply from the fire line), due to which the effective pressure in the foam line remained inadequate. Both the anchor wash and the hydrant on the poop deck were shut and the pressure increased in the foam line, and the foam monitors could provide an adequate water jet. However, the PSCO pointed out that this investigation caused a delay in finally having the fully charged foam monitors in operation on deck, and hence noted the deficiency. At the same time while deck rounds were in progress, the CBP also boarded the vessel for inward clearance and face check of all crew onboard which also contributed to the delay in investigating the cause of the lower pressure in the foam main. Master confirmed to the USCG PSCO that all crew onboard were familiar with the operation of the fixed foam fire extinguishing system and regular drills and familiarization pertaining to the foam system were being carried out. The last fire drill was carried out on 19th April 2023. The boat and fire drills conducted as part of the USCG inspection were conducted without any concerns raised by the PSCO.

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: To avoid recurrence a telephonic briefing of Master and other senior management team was carried out by the vessel's superintendent and the importance of preparing the fixed foam firefighting system for operation was emphasized. Officers were briefed with regards to this short coming and were advised to improvise on man management during concurrent inspections and the importance of squaring off and securing all the valves after and inspection or a drill. The process of securing all LSA/FFA items after each use / try-out was also discussed in detail. The ship staff were counselled to effectively delegate tasks once simultaneous visits by shore authorities are intimated. The finding was shared with other vessels in the fleet to avoid a recurrence.

Deficiency/Finding: Self-igniting light of one lifebuoy on poop deck unlit.

Description Overview: During the PSC inspection, a life buoy equipped with a self-igniting light located at the stern was tested (moved to an upright position). However, the light did not activate due to drained battery. Upon reviewing the ship's records, it was found that this life-saving equipment had been inspected twice prior to the PSC inspection. The first inspection occurred during the monthly check on May 28, 2024. The second inspection took place before the vessel's arrival at the port of inspection in Bayuquan, China, on June 5, 2024, in compliance with the Company's requirement for PSC preparation using the checklist MZ-5703 PSC Inspection Checklist (prior ARRIVAL). During both inspections, the life-saving equipment in question was noted as 'good' with no further remarks. The Company believes that the frequent testing and the extended service life of the battery contributed to its depletion.

Immediate Causes: Defective Tool/ Equipment (25)

Root Cause Analysis: Job/ System Factors - Improper decision on extension of service life (13.2)

Corrective Action: 1) Immediately after the deficiency was pointed out, new batteries were installed to the self-igniting light in question with the presence of PSCO. It is also to note that during the time of inspection, all other life buoys attached with a connected self-igniting light was found to be in order (excepted to the pointed out item).

Preventive Action: 1) Company held an occasional safety committee meeting on the 10th of June 2024 to discuss this PSC Deficiency issued and have agreed to formulate below corrective action measures. 2) The Routine monthly inspection including the pre-arrival inspection at every port as mentioned on the above narrative is to continue as usual. Despite one item found defective, the fact that other self-igniting light is in good order as well all the rest of the LSA at the time of inspection proves that this checks is effective. (This deficiency is being considered as minor). 3) In spite of other self-igniting light is found to be in good working order (and not expired), it was decided to renew/ change all batteries all at once after the inspection was carried out in order to prevent similar unexpected depletion of batteries. 4) For all crew's awareness, this deficiency item will be circulated to the fleet. 5) For verification of condition of similar inspection item to other vessel of the fleet, All Superintendent are tasked to check condition of this LSA on next scheduled ship visitations.

Immediate Causes: It is standard procedure to maintain a gangway watchman at all times which in this case was temporarily not followed as watchman was called aft to assist with adjusting the mooring lines due to the swell.

Root Cause Analysis: OOW (3/O) felt self-driven pressure to ensure vessel was safely secured alongside in heavy swell conditions within the port. This led him to take all 3 ratings on watch with him, including the gangway watchman in a routine adjustment of the aft mooring lines, without waiting for a replacement.

Corrective Action: Gangway watchman returned to gangway security post from mooring station aft. Master held a full crew meeting on the same day of the inspection to remind on the gangway control procedures and remind of the absolute need to maintain a gangway watchman at all times with him leaving his post, for any non-emergency tasks, only after a replacement has arrived.

Preventive Action: Deficiency has been circulated fleet wide with reminder on the absolute nature of the gangway watchman requirement. Superintendents have been instructed to focus on gangway control practices during their attendances. Issue will be further discussed during upcoming officers' conference in mid-October.

Deficiency/Finding: Navigational officers are not familiar with basic operations of the ECDIS. During inspection, navigational officers could not plot a manual position fix using LOP. Furthermore, it took an excessively long time before the e-NP's could be consulted. The attending officers, including the officer which pretended to have prepared the previous passage plan, had not idea where to look for the e-NP's. Also, it should be noted, no decent voyage planning for the inbound voyage could be presented during inspection. 30/10/2023: Once again, crew had difficulties in order to find e-NP.

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: Same was confirmed by Company's attending Superintendent. Although Navigational Officers certificates were checked during investigation and confirmed in order (e.g. CoC, ECDIS Specific) OOW demonstrated unfamiliarity with basic operation of ECDIS and e-NP'S. As 2nd officer has joined the vessel for over a week, we consider matter also as failure during hand over/ take over procedures where not adequate attention was paid by taking over officer at the time of hand over. Extra training is required. Regarding the issue arising on 30/10/2023 for the e-NP's, root cause could be considered as miscommunication between vessel's Officers and PSC Officers. 2nd Officer was asked to demonstrate e-NPs on ECDIS, 2nd Officer typed eNP and not e-NP (ie typo error) on his first attempt. While 2nd officer immediately corrected the typo, PSC officer considered this minor typo error as a difficulty to find e-NP and decided not to close out at that time the deficiency on the 30.10.2023.

Root Cause Analysis: Fire detector weekly and three-monthly testing records are kept per the PMS (codes 50.11 and 50.11.01). Despite the fact that the company's SMS include a comprehensive Form M036 the Electrician is designated as the person responsible for the testing and record keeping of all sensors on board. In this case, the Electrician was recording in a personal notebook all the tested sensors as well as the pending sensors that must be tested. The SMS includes a controlled form M036 consisting of comprehensive list which must be completed individual by every ship. Due to inadequate monitoring by Chief Engineer the electrician was not aware about the company's specific form as a result to impose the observation regarding the non-availability of these evidences.

Corrective Action: The Electrician before completion of the inspection transferred the data from his own notebook to the controlled specific form M036 and upload it so as to be in compliance with the company's procedures. Moreover, sample of the detectors were tested in the presence of the PSC officer with satisfactory results.

Deficiency/Finding: Fixed fire extinguishing installation not ready for immediate use. Maintenance pin in place for one cylinder, two pilot lines stretched and kinked. Compressed air hose connected to main manifold with valve in open position.

Description Overview: During the inspection, the PSCO visually examined the CO2 fixed installation to ensure its constant readiness. Although no any damage was found, the PSCO noticed that one CO2 cylinder (Type A) had safety pin incorrectly applied, hindering its immediate release. Additionally, two pilot lines were observed to be stretched due to secure clamps, causing external stretching but not obstructing CO2 flow. The PSCO confirmed that CO2 could still pass through these lines without issues. Furthermore, the PSCO noticed the compressed air hose connected to the main manifold had its valve left open, possibly during routine pre-arrival inspections by the vessel's crew.

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: The fixed firefighting system undergoes annual and monthly inspections, adhering to the company's PMS/SMS interval requirements. The most recent annual inspection, conducted on May 18th, 2023, was carried out by an approved workshop. The last monthly inspection was carried out on Dec 16, 2023, by Second Engineer. No issues reported. Furthermore, an inspection was carried out on Dec 5, 2023, by a 3rd party appointed company (MER Solutions) without any reported issues. These pins are mandatory during CO2 bottles transportation and testing ashore, with the crew responsible for their installation prior removal and subsequently their removal upon return onboard. The vessel completed its scheduled dry-dock works in August 2022. It seems improbable that a safety pin oversight occurred during Dry-dock, given the thorough inspection by the authorized workshop in May 2023. The likely explanation is that the crew unintentionally left a pin secured in a recent drill took place. The same explanation applies for the manifold open valve. As regards the stretched line, occurred during line end tightening. The CO2 flow was not impacted.

Corrective Action: a. Maintenance pin of the CO2 cylinder observed to be in place was immediately removed, while two pilot lines / hoses were replaced by new spare available on board and the main manifold valve for compressed air connection was closed. b. The Classification Society conducted a remote survey at the port of inspection, verifying and confirming the rectification of the imposed deficiency. c. Corrective action verified during re-inspection by PSCO and the deficiency closed as same indicated in the follow up report.

Preventive Action: a. Send a safety alert to all vessels, emphasizing the proper use of CO2 safety pins. Due date Jan 15, 2024. b. Discuss this case in the next safety meeting onboard. Due date Jan 31, 2024.

Deficiency/Finding: Radio Log (Diary)

Description Overview: Not as required

Immediate Causes: (1) Failure to inform. The last remaining Radio Log book on board is already expected to ran out from May 2024 and supply could not be arranged on time due to inconvenient port of calls. At the time that the radio log book had ran out, no corresponding action was done to address the issue. Master decided to use xerox- copied blank page of Radio Log book. There was no attempt to request for Radio Log book that are available in the local Market to use as temporary records.
(2) Failure to follow procedures. Marshall Islands (RMI) has own sample of GMDSS Radio Log Book (Form MI-104L) as per Marine Notice No. 4-033-7. Master should have used this format as temporary records instead of the xerox-copied radio log book.

Root Cause Analysis: Inadequate identification of requirements. It is presumed that the requirements of SOLAS Ch. IV/Reg. 17 were not been realized. The GMDSS Radio Log Book is required to be carried on board therefore the Flag State should have been informed to issue dispensation letter at the time when the radio log book pages had run out.

Corrective Action: Store supplier was informed to rush the supply of GMDSS Log Book. Master was also instructed that, upon receipt of the GMDSS Radio Log Book they must transfer the contents of xerox-copied log book into the standard log book and report the rectification works to PSCO Constanta, Romania.

Preventive Action: The company had also instructed all related personnel (Master and in-charge shore personnel) to exert best effort to maintain sufficient volumes of GMDSS Log books available onboard and to apply the proper contingency procedures when the GMDSS Radio Log Book will ran out and no spare log book available for use.

Description Overview: One reset button and one sound sensor of BNWAS located behind the curtain cannot provide proper look-out in wheelhouse.

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: . The vessel was fitted by previous owners/managers with Navgard™ BNWAS manufactured by Martek Marine. The system is designed to comply with SOLAS Regulation V/19 as amended by MSC.282 (86) and is meeting the requirements of the performance standards set out by MSC.128 (75) & IEC 62616. · The vessel is subject to a survey regime during its service life consisting among others of special, intermediate and annual surveys with the purpose of confirming that the condition of hull, machinery, systems, equipment, appliances and fittings remains in compliance with the applicable rules. . The responsible RO (NK) at the time of installation of the BNWAS did not make any comments regarding the positioning of the reset buttons during installation. The installation drawings were reviewed by NK, approved and confirmed compliant with the approved drawing after completion of installation. · When the vessel entered under Company's management and the RO has been replaced, the attending surveyor of the new RO (KR) had analyzed the configuration of the system and how the requirement found at subparagraph 4.1.3.1 of MSC.128 (75) is fulfilled: 'It should not be possible to initiate the reset function or cancel any audible alarm from any device, equipment or system not physically located in areas of the bridge providing proper lookout' . An assessment was jointly conducted with the Company's representative and some additional measures were adopted on the spot. The assessment was related to the reset button fitted inside the chart room area. It has been considered that the view of the OOW is obstructed during dark hours when the curtains are enclosing the space. Firstly, it was assessed the purpose of the chart room. This space has been designed at the building stage with the user in mind. It is a space dedicated to paper chart work and ship positioning fixing during the times when paper charts were used for navigation. It was provided with a curtain to prevent the light from the chartroom to blind the bridge team vision at night when the room was temporarily used for navigation purposes. The designed function of the chartroom lost its importance once with the introduction of paper navigation. Worth mentioning the ECDIS system is placed at the front of the bridge in same alignment with the radars. Secondly, it was assessed the necessity, frequency and timing required for the OOW to visit the chartroom under any navigational condition during dark periods versus the purpose of a BNWAS as indicated by MSC.128 (75) as to 'monitor bridge activity and detect operator disability which could lead to marine accidents. The system monitors the awareness of the Officer of the Watch (OOW) and automatically alerts the Master or another qualified OOW if for any reason the OOW becomes incapable of performing the OOW's duties.' Checking the manning levels of the vessel it was found that during dark periods the OOW is assisted automatically by one A/B and under specific situations the manning level of the bridge team is supported by additional officers and deck crew as necessary. Based on the above it was concluded that the reset of BNWAS during dark hours, even from the chart room, is not interfere with the requirements of a proper look out since this function is satisfied by the lookout function of the A/B or extra rating as might be deemed necessary. . Notwithstanding the above, in order not to be in a position to explain some PSCO who might not be so familiar with all the functions of a BNWAS and the requirements of MSC.128 (75) it has been decided to place a label to the effect of not resetting the BNWAS form the button installed in the chartroom. · What the attending inspector intended to demonstrate by removing the magnet from the reset panel evidence nothing but the fact that he was not familiar with the functions of the BNWAS installed on board and the MSC.128 (75) requirements interpretation ad applied in practice.

Corrective Action: . Although not necessary at all, in consultation with the attending KR surveyor, the curtain has been repositioned in order to have the reset button outside the obscured area at night.

These certificates have been reissued as short-term certificates on 16/10/2022 with a validity until 15/02/2022. This way of extending the validity of certificates is not in line with the provisions of SOLAS. The only possible way to extend the validity of certificates is by endorsing them as per SOLAS 1988 Amend / Chapter I (HSSC) / Reg. 14 in order to complete the voyage. In relation to the extended validity of certificates and the postponed dry dock (ref deficiency 01102), it should be noted several deck structures are heavily corroded/wasted (E.G .: vent heads (oil/fuel tanks) next to CO2 room, several supporting structures (bars and clamps for deck piping).

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: Non availability of docking space in shipyard

Corrective Action: Company has an electronic tool for monitoring the validity of certificates for vessels. The tool is equipped with the feature of giving an alert for any certificate expiry. The expiry of certificate for the vessel is also a feature on each superintendent dashboard. Vessel was planned for routine drydock in last week of October 2022 at Dakarnave shipyard at Dakar. All spares and paints were already ordered and mobilized for delivery at Dakar. In the meantime, we got a letter from the shipyard for nonavailability of space due to pandemic of COVID 19 and drydock running behind schedule. The shipyard confirmed available date was week 4-5 of 2023. At this stage we tried finding an alternate shipyard for docking of vessel in the region including the Mediterranean. No dock space was available. Since all spares and paints were mobilized for delivery to shipyard at Dakar, owners were left with limited option of approaching Flag state for possible extension of docking survey. An extension was approved for 3 months subject to commencement of a special survey and carrying out maximum possible inspection for issuance of short-term certificate with validity of 3 months. Flag email attached for your kind perusal. Occasional survey was carried out by Class BV in line with Flag approval on 16 October at Guinea Konakry and short-term certificates were issued to the vessel. Survey report attached. Underwater inspection was carried out on 12 November 2022 for extension of docking survey as well. Underwater survey inspection report attached for your kind perusal. In view of docking being extended and condition of air vents not being very good, a confirm order for supply of prefabricated air vent was placed in Rotterdam and were connected during the PSC inspection. The vents were fitted during the inspection. Pipe clamps were renewed as well during the vessel stay at berth and same was cleared by the PSC inspector prior to vessel departure from port.

Preventive Action: We had an online meeting with senior management staff of shipyard in order to brief them the with regard to condition which we as ship managers are in after the postponement of dock space availability for the vessel. Shipyard senior management was clearly briefed on maintaining the schedule if the docking is confirmed for any future vessel. Office superintendents were briefed by senior management to be in touch with dry dock once contract is awarded for monitoring of docking space until vessel finally is in dry dock.

Deficiency/Finding: Ventilator of Bosun Store Found Not Weather Tight

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: In fact, a vent serving the bosun store in the forecastle was found with a detached gasket. The investigation revealed that during the deck tour, the PSC officer asked for the bosun store vent to be opened and upon opening it was seen that the rubber gasket had come detached and fallen onto the deck. Air vents are included in the ship's PMS and are subject to thorough inspection at monthly intervals. Last checked on 20-3-2024 (see attached report) with no defects. As the vessel had passed its annual class inspection recently as well as a clean PSC inspection in Paranagua on 19-2-2024 (as attached), they concluded that the rubber gasket had been detached only at the time of inspection due to its continuous exposure to the weather and sea salt. However, we noted this observation with concern. Root cause: defected material

Corrective Action: Crew replaced the sealing rubber immediately. (see attached photos). Above findings rectified / closed to the satisfaction of the PSC inspector before disembarkation.

Preventive Action: Master was instructed to inspect all rubber sealing as soon as possible after departure since the vent heads on deck are seriously affected by weather factors.

Deficiency/Finding: Echo Sounder not displaying reading

Description Overview: The vessel is equipped with navigational systems and equipment that adhere to SOLAS Chapter 5, Regulation 19, and, as verified by the inspector, all navigational equipment required by the Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificate (Form B) and the 'ABS Record of Approved Cargo Ship Safety Equipment' has been observed to be in optimal working condition. However, during the port stay, an intermittent issue was encountered with the echosounder, which ceased to display the Under Keel Clearance (UKC) or depth information. Initially, the bridge team attributed this issue to the presence of muddy river water alongside the terminal. Subsequently, the ship's staff undertook troubleshooting on board, leading to the discovery that the depth display malfunctioned due to improper gain adjustment settings. Following the necessary adjustment of the gain settings, the echosounder successfully resumed its accurate display of depth information. Concurrently, the Master of the vessel conducted a comprehensive Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and disseminated vital information to the entire bridge team. This briefing encompassed the inherent restrictions and limitations associated with the use of the echosounder device, particularly in effectively monitoring the Under Keel Clearance (UKC) or depth. The JSA also outlined mitigation measures, emphasizing the essential requirement for regular checks to ensure the echosounder's operational readiness. The responsibility for conducting these checks was designated to the Officer of the Watch (OOW) as part of their routine duties. This proactive approach underscores our commitment to maintaining navigational equipment in optimal working condition and upholding safe navigation practices.

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: Incorrect setting/ Use of the equipment: Since the Echosounder device was completely operational in the previous ports and also while approaching Cochin, OOW did not adjust the gain setting believing that the Under Keel Clearance/depth alongside is fluctuating due to the transducer getting cluttered by muddy river water.

Corrective Action: The ship's crew promptly conducted onboard troubleshooting and successfully determined that the depth display issue was attributed to an improper gain adjustment setting. Following the meticulous adjustment of the gain setting, the echosounder promptly resumed its accurate and reliable display of depth information on the echosounder screen. Concurrently, the vessel's Master undertook a comprehensive Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and subsequently provided a detailed briefing to the entire bridge team. This briefing focused on illuminating the various restrictions and limitations associated with the operation of the echosounder device, particularly in relation to effective monitoring of the Under Keel Clearance (UKC) and depth. The JSA not only highlighted potential risks but also outlined mitigation measures to enhance safety. Furthermore, the JSA underscored the paramount importance of regular checks to ensure the continued operational integrity of the echosounder. These checks were designated as a specific responsibility of the Officer of the Watch (OOW) and are to be conducted on a routine basis. This proactive approach

Deficiency/Finding: PS aft accommodation ladder is bended, however, it can still be used without any restrictions until August 2024. Midhsip 'pilot assist' ladders PS and SB: the attachment of the aluminium ladder to the top platform is severely corroded, resulting in a permanent deformation of the aluminium ladder, incl. structural strengthening. All accommodation ladders at aft and the 'pilot assist' ladders at midship have undergone a repeat load test with a weight (used on all) of 800 kg. As per markings (vessel build after 01-01-2010) the maximum safe working load is 75 kg per step (e.g. aft ship ladders consists of 46 steps -> 3450 kg load). No proper marking on the 'pilot assist' ladders at midship available as required. Other markings, as required, are unreadable at the positions required (e.g. winches). The gangway, placed in front of the accommodation (acc. crew this is called the 'extension ladder') has not been load tested at 5yearly intervals. No records of repeat load testing is available on board.

Deficiency/Finding: Access / structural features (ship).

Description Overview: Gangway incorrectly / unsafely rigged.

Immediate Causes: The height of the main continuous deck from the jetty (terminal) was high enough for gangway ladder to be steeper than 50 degrees, hence portable gangway could not be used. Since the vessel was discharging this would have only gotten steeper. The terminal did not provide any gangway/ ladder for safe access between the shore and the ship. The vessel lowered the accommodation ladder for providing safe access, but the bollard on the jetty was hindering the ladder to be fully lowered till the jetty level. The turn table of the accommodation ladder could not be rotated as there were some obstructions kept near the ladder on the jetty that caused obstruction. In view of this obstruction on shore terminal, the ladder was kept slightly above the jetty and that led to the observation.

Root Cause Analysis: Inadequate access between ship and shore due to no clear space to land gangway on terminal.

Corrective Action: On being pointed out, the terminal as requested to move the obstructions and the turn table was rotated and then the fixed gangway was rested on the jetty, which was noted as rectified by the PSCO. Please see attached photographic evidence of gangway placement on the jetty.

Preventive Action: We will include this observation in our quarterly QHSE bulletin to promulgate the importance of having safe access between ship and shore. In cases where shore can't provide a safe landing area for the ship's gangway and neither do the shore provide a boarding arrangement, we encourage our vessels to issue a letter of protest and use the Pilot / combination ladder for boarding from off-shore side.

Deficiency/Finding: At the time of inspection, when operating the generator in blackout simulation mode, the emergency generator demonstrated a problem with the overspeed sensor and was not operating properly due to the sensor shutting down the engine.

Description Overview: On 01 February 2024, during Port State Control Inspection following deficiency was raised: At the time of inspection, when operating the generator in blackout simulation mode, the emergency generator demonstrated a problem with the overspeed sensor and was not operating properly due to the sensor shutting down the engine.

Immediate Causes: Trouble shooting immediately commenced. The company was informed. Flag Administration and Classification Society were informed by the company. Class requested to attend the vessel.

Root Cause Analysis: The PSC officer asked the officers to test the operation of the emergency generator. The emergency generator was successfully tested by both means, battery and hydraulics, to the satisfaction of the PSC officer. After successfully starting the generator, the PSC officer asked to test the automatic start of the emergency generator by simulating a blackout. The generator started up, however an overspeed fault occurred and caused the engine to shut down. Immediately the officers started dealing with the problem. After detailed examination of the engine and its electrical and mechanical parts by Technical Superintendent the Chief Engineer and the Electrician, it was revealed that the cause was not mechanical or electrical, but an adjustment of the potentiometer that controls the speed of the generator. Due to the fact that no instructions were found in makers manual for the correct adjustment of the speed control potentiometer and the throttle linkage controller, the office staff initiated trouble shooting assistance with makers authorized engineer. The issue was resolved a few hours later after the disembarkation of PSC officer.

Deficiency/Finding: Following installation of a Ballast Water Treatment System the Master, Owner, Operator, Agent or person in charge must properly maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specification. Vessel operator has reported the TRO sensor and Dew point sensor are not functioning correctly. The vessel has worked with the manufacturer to simulate the output of these sensors.

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: Root cause of subject deficiency lies to failure of the TRO and the Dew point Sensors. The Vessel / Company had received an extension earlier in 2023, specifically on 15-Feb-2023 to use the AMS accepted ballast water treatment system, until it could be upgraded to the USCG type approved version. The extension was granted until 15-Feb-2024. Unfortunately, the NK-03 Blue Ballast system malfunctioned, and the system remained inoperative due to challenges related to the maker's competence, availability, and attendance onboard. Thus, we requested a discharge of ballast water in extraordinary circumstances due to the BWMS not operating properly as provided in 33 CFR151.2040. Prior ship's call at Baltimore 31-Oct-2023, ship's Managers proactively informed the USCG COTP regarding the condition of the BWTS. Specifically, the following was provided to the USCG COTP: - Flag Administration had been notified and a relevant Dispensation Letter was available. - In connection to the above, Class DNV had issued the Short- Term Ballast Water Management Certificate; the Certificate contained Flag's consent to apply the D-1 method as a contingency measure. - Prior arrival in US, the Master proceeded with relevant calculations and obtained permission to discharge minimum ballast water to load cargo with safe stability, strength, trim, etc. - Prior arrival US, the vessel conducted Ballast Water Exchange mid-ocean (D-1), as per the ship's Ballast Water Management Plan and in line with 33 CFR 151-20250(g). - Details of the failure and repair plan were provided, declaring amongst others, that depending on where the ship goes after the US, the attendance of the maker's service engineer would be arranged as required. - The Master included the inoperable BWMS in the eNOA. - The Master documented relevant details in the ship's log. - The agent was notified. - USCG COTP was informed that depending on the cargo quantity; if applicable, the Master shall make arrangements for sealing those Ballast Water tanks that shall not be discharged and sufficient notices to prevent discharge would be displayed. - COTP would be kept up to date as required.

Corrective Action: Following the Vessel's departure from Baltimore in November 2023, and as discussed on board between USCG Inspectors, our attending Technical Supt. and our QI Gallagher, all efforts were undertaken to resolve the issue with the BWTS. The Dew-Point Sensor was replaced and the USCG upgrade kit was successfully installed during the Vessel's next port of call following Baltimore, specifically in Tuna, India in 12th-16th-December-2023. The System's maker was onboard during the replacement of the sensors and proceeded with the installation of the USCG upgrade kit. Upon installation thereof, the maker witnessed the system running under test mode and confirmed it functioned properly. Following the USCG kit's successful installation, after the vessel sailed from Tuna, India (where the BWTS was witnessed to have been fully operational by the maker), the Vessel's crew proceeded with full run of the system. However, during the system's operation, we encountered several issues, that had not been identified before the USCG upgrade kit installation. We thereafter followed the maker's advice and we have ordered the necessary spares. However, the lead time is very significant, and the spares haven't been delivered onboard as of today. In an effort to exhaust all possible options and to have all the relevant items rectified with the best and the fastest possible means, our Technical Manager visited the makers NK in Korea end of February. The purpose of the meeting was to find a viable solution on the problems encountered with the BWTS. An action plan has been agreed and our Technical Department is now working closely with the maker to implement the said plan and resolve the issues. We have reached out to the Flag Administrator (Liberia) once again to request an extension to the existing Dispensation Letter. In this regard, the Flag has authorized the vessel's Classification Society to Administratively extend the short-Term International Ballast Water Management Certificate, valid up to 7th April 2024, with a relevant annotation / statement to operate the BWTS in ""manual mode"", and to apply the D-1 standard as a contingency measure on the vessel, should the BWTS become completely in-operational. The required spares have now been purchased and will be delivered on board at ship's next port of call. Arrangements are in progress for makers service engineers to attend and rectify the issues.

Preventive Action: Continue close contact with system's maker in case further issues / discrepancies arise. Monitor the operation of the BWTS with ship's responsible Officers and the head office Superintendents, as well as with the Maker.

Deficiency/Finding: To discharge ballast water into the waters of the United States, the master, owner, operator, agent or person in charge of a vessel subject to 151.2025 of this subpart must either ensure that the ballast water meets the ballast water discharge standard in 151.2030 (a), use an AMS as described in 151.2025 (a) (3), or ballast with water from U.S public water system, according to the schedule in paragraph (b) of this section. Currently, vessel's installed BWTS is inoperative. Vessel is not authorized to discharge untreated ballast into the waters of the U.S. without prior written authorization from the local captain of the port under the provisions of 33 CFR 151.2040 (b).

Description Overview: Vessel is fitted with BWMS Make: PANASIA, Model: GloEN-Patrol, which uses filtration and UV principle for the ballast water treatment. The model is approved as per USCG requirements which operates both in IMO and USCG mode and has been found in good working condition. As an additional redundancy measure, 'Tank to tank' upgrade for the system was completed on 02nd May 2022 by the maker's service engineer and the BWMS was tested to be in good working order. The uptake of ballast onboard was from Montreal (Canada) through BWMS used in IMO mode. It was exchanged using the BWMS in USCG mode at open sea while the vessel was en-route to Houston(USA). The BWMS was fully operational as per USCG requirements. The vessel commenced deballasting on 08th July22 12:30 concurrent to cargo loading operation. The BWMS was being used in USCG mode and per company guidelines. The loading operation was split into 14 stages during which the cargo was being blended onboard. Each stage was carefully specified by the terminal and required the cargo tanks to be loaded in a specific sequence, sometimes only port tanks or stbd tanks at a time. This required regular adjusting of ballast.

Immediate Causes: As soon as issue was noted with the BWMS, the deballasting operation was stopped, all corresponding valves closed. The deballasting was only resumed after written authorization was received from USCG COTP at 11th July22 1908LT. Amended ballast reporting form was submitted by vessel to NBIC immediately. As part of initial trouble shooting, the UV lamps and capacitors were changed, UV intensity transmitter & housing were cleaned but the system could not be made operational in USCG mode in port. After departure from port, the BWMS was run at open sea and confirmed to be working in good order in both IMO and USCG mode. Segregated ballast tanks 4P, 4S was visually inspected (which were being deballasted when the equipment malfunctioned) after an enclosed space entry permit was issued and all safety measures were in place. It was noted that remaining tank water is clear without excessive turbidity and accumulation of mud.

Root Cause Analysis: During the starting of the BWMS for either ballasting or deballasting, pre-warming for lining up & UV lamps is carried out which is in Sea to Sea Mode. Until the required value reaches a satisfactory level of treatment Dose (As defined by USCG) in USCG mode, the system does not allow to take ballast from the ballast tanks and de-ballast operation cannot be started. Since the inbuilt software of BWMS requires a warmup cycle of about 15 minutes and then changeover to treatment mode, including auto clean up of UV sensors during the operation hence closer to the completion of deballasting operation system started giving UV lamp low intensity and was rendered in operational on 10th July22, 1423LT. After initial troubleshooting, the vessel immediately informed the company and USCG COTP, through agents, requesting permission to deballast the remaining 1600m3 ballast without use of BWMS. The system was still fully operational in 'IMO' mode but was not able to comply with more stringent 'USCG' mode requirements.

Corrective Action: Company arranged for maker's technician attendance at vessel's next convenient port of call after Houston, at Panama on 17-20th July2022 where the capacitors, UV lamps and sleeves were replaced, and renewal of UV transmitter and housing was recommended. The maker's technician attendance was again carried out in Panama between 09th _ 11th September when the UV transmitter and housing were renewed. The vessel's BWTS plant records and logs were checked by Technician. It was confirmed that BWTS plant was operating properly, within maker's prescribed limits during previous ports of call. Upon investigation, it was noted that while system is working in USCG Mode, the UV dose does not rise above 60mwcm2. As soon as 'warming up' is finished, open the overboard. the system goes into 'de-ballast' mode. UV does quickly begin to rise. Problem was fixed. Further, the service engineer replaced starboard side UV intensity transmitter for unit # 1-1 & 2-2 in addition he also replaced port side UV intensity sensor for UV unit # 2-1.

Preventive Action: Finally, the system was tried out tank to tank in both IMO / USCG mode found to be running satisfactorily and confirmed by technician. Further additional spares are recommended which company will source from the makers and connect to vessel at convenient port. (Attached Service report) vessels are instructed to have proper mitigating measures in place and in line with COTP guidelines, all company vessels calling to ports where these challenging water conditions exist, are carrying out ballast water exchange through BWTS in open sea prior arrival to the port and report limitations of the equipment in their ENOA to keep the COTP duly appraised.
